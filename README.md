# CMC BH-30 Controller Menu
This program is for use with a CMC BH-30 HF linear amplifier in an amateur radio application.

It's meant to run on a Raspberry Pi with an LCD display, buttons, and relay board.

The selected relay shorts one of 16 pins to a common pin in order to select the pre-defined "channel" set on the amplifier.

Selecting a band by pressing a button or by using the CLI menu will tell the BH-30 to switch bands.

If the band selected is already the active band, the program will retrieve and display the latest DX spots for that band.

More info to come.
